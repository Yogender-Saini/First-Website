    <li>If everyone is happy with you, then
        surely you have made many
        compromises in your life.
        
        And if you are happy with everyone,
        then surely you have ignored many
        Faults of others.
        </li>
    <li>When you give Importance to
        People
        they think that
        You are always Free
        But
        They donâ€™t Understand that
        You make yourself
        Avaliable for Them everytime. 
        </li>
    <li>The pain never leaves us we have to leave the pain.</li>
    <li>People want
        to see you
        doing better...
        But NOT better
        than Them.
        </li>
    <li>Life is not the same with everyone; so think twice before judging others</li>
    <li>Whenever you re
        having a burden in
        your heart, share it
        
        It'll make you feel
        better.

    <h1>Early  Humans</h1>
    <p>Homo habilis, or "handy man," lived in Eastern and Southern Africa between 2.4 million and 1.4 million years ago and is one of the earliest known humans. Mar 5, 2020</p>
    <p>The first archaic Homo sapiens may have evolved 650,000 years ago, but the majority lived after 300,000 years ago. The Neandertals were the last and best-known of them, living until nearly 28,000 years ago. Archaic Homo sapiens is also known as "archaic humans" and "early Homo sapiens."</p>
